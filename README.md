# Password complexity checker

🔐 Password Complexity Checker (Prodigy Internship)
This project is developed as part of the Prodigy Infotech program to build a Python tool that evaluates the strength of passwords based on standard security criteria. It provides users with feedback to help improve password safety and awareness.



💡 What It Does
The tool checks if a password includes:

✅ Minimum required length

✅ Uppercase and lowercase letters

✅ Numbers

✅ Special characters (e.g., @, #, !, etc.)

It then classifies the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong, and suggests improvements if necessary.



✨ Features
Analyzes password strength in real-time

Clear feedback and rating system

Easy to customize and expand

Great for learning string handling and logic-building in Python



🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3

No external libraries required



🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Psalunkhe07/password-checker-prodigy.git
cd password-checker-prodigy
Run the script:


python password_checker.py
Enter a password when prompted and view the feedback.



🧪 Sample Output

Enter your password: Priy@123
Password Strength: Strong
Great job! Your password is secure.



📚 Applications
Login form security checks

Learning about password policies

Building safer authentication systems



🔧 Future Enhancements
GUI version with Tkinter

Integration into web apps

Password breach detection via external APIs
